This app uses data from Timothy Renners' page which contains UFO sightings data
in the US and Canada from 2016. The data contains Date, Time, AM/PM, Country,
City, State, Shape, latitude, longitude and Summary.

The widgets in this app include radio buttons and a numeric input box. The radio
buttons control whether the bar graphs include data from the US or Canada, the
default being the US. The numeric input box allows the user to select a particular
month from 2016 to plot a bar graph. The default value, 0, returns the main panel
to the bar graph of all months in 2016.

The main panel, initially contains a bar graph of every month in 2016 and the
frequency of UFO sightings per month. If the user inputs a number into the numeric
text box then the main panel converts into a bar graph of that month and the number of
UFO sightings per day during that month.
